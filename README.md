# moodS
my first fully self crated C++ project, some kind of diary to input  and monitor your mental state

-> app allows user to input their mood (bad, neutral, good) every day and add details why they feel that way (up to five sentences)

-> all data is stored in .txt file which is loaded everytime the app is running or created if its the first time

-> there is a singly linked list to go through all the saved days

-> the user can add his mood state once a day, view all the days, see the comparision of all made logs and delete unwanted logs

-> ctime library used to get the current date

-> vector variable to collect mood description
